Right off the bat, I like how your layout makes it easy to identify a central 
point of the program (the UI). I also appreciate how you've identified how each
class realates to another; though it might benefit an outside reader to have 
more bingo-specific words than "contains" (like what it means for the UI to 
conatain a deck) but that's a total  personal preference so if it works for you
then I wouldn't worry about it! 
One thing syntactically that I notice is your notation for private methods/
variables is a little inconsistent. It looks like you use the "-/+" syntax for
most of them, but on a few you've left the method name with "__" and denoted it
public with the "+". Not a huge issue as it is still clear what you mean, but
it might help down the line if notation is consistent.
Another thing I noticed is that I don't see any constructors (the __init__ 
functions) in your UML. From what I understand about the program, all of the
classes have constructors, but if you've found another way to do the program 
without referencing objects (which, hats off to you if you did!) then nevermind.
If you are using the constructors though, it helped me a lot to get the bones
of each constructor down on my UML so that I understood how each object was 
created. Again though, I don't know how you're planing to do it, so you do you!
You did a good job of describing the types for all of your data, and I think you
did a great job overall!
