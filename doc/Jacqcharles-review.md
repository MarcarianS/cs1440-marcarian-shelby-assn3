The first thing I notice about your diagram is the dashed line 
between menu and menuOptions. Obviously you might have gone a 
different path from what the starter code did, but in the starter
code it seems like Menu uses functions involving MenuOption, and
can not function as a class without accessing menu option. I may
be misunderstanding UML as well, which is very likely! If you
have pulled of Menu without explicitly needing menuOption, more
power to you!
The nest thing I see is the function descriptions. From what I 
understand of UML, the purpose of a function is not supposed to
be included, just the types going in and coming out. It makes it
a bit less wordy, and easier to understand just the very bones of
the program. If those are in there as reminders to you, no
problem, but I do think we're supposed to take that out before
we turn them in.
The final thing I would think about is that it looks like you 
might be missing a few functions and variables/atributes that 
are used in the starter code, but not yet defined. They're worth
the time it takes to figure them out, they definitely are helpng 
me avoid forcing functions to do more than they should!
A nitpicky thing, it looks like you don't have indicators of
how your dependent classes relate (like your "uses" for the dashed
lines). Overall though, the flow is intuitive and I like how clean
it is. Good work!
