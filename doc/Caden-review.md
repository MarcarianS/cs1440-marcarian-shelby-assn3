The first thing I notice about your UML is that some of 
your classes don't have attributes. I looked a little 
closer and found them in with the methods. It might just 
make things more obvious to the reader if there are seperate
sections in all classes, because it looks like you have them
for Card and Deck already. 
The next thing I see is that there aren't may descriptors
between the different classes (like how does a UI relate
to a Deck).
I didn't see constructors for UI or Menu, but it looks like
you did make one for menu and called it init.
Reading through yours reminded me to add the bingo class 
into mine, which I honestly didn't think about since it has
just about nothing in it other than a call for UI.
I like the flow of the diagram as well, it makes it very clear
how the data goes through the program, and reads easily 
from left to right. That felt really natural and helped the
intuition behind your diagram come through.
Looking closer at deck, I like that you put in the bounds
for what each variable could be, because that helps to remind 
the reader which variables can be what numbers,
versus when to throw the menu up again for invalid input.
It was also smart to put little reminders for yourself in 
Card for what some of the variables mean; I'll definitely
have to go through and do this for some of the variables
that are tripping me up!
